# Node-Based Visual Pipeline Editor - Frontend

This project implements the frontend for a dynamic, node-based visual pipeline editor. Users can construct, configure, and visualize complex data or operational workflows. It features a modern interface built with React, utilizing React Flow for its powerful diagramming capabilities and Zustand for efficient state management.

**Note on Backend Interaction:** The "Submit Pipeline" feature in this live demo attempts to connect to a backend service expected to be running on `http://localhost:8000`. To test this specific functionality, please clone the full project repository and run the backend server locally as per the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file.

##  Features

*   **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Easily add and arrange various node types on an infinite canvas.
*   **Custom Node Abstraction:** A flexible `BaseNode` component allows for rapid development and consistent styling of diverse node types.
    *   Includes core nodes: Input, Output, LLM, Text.
    *   Extended with utility nodes: Number, Math Operation, Condition, Merge, and Logger.
*   **Dynamic Text Node:**
    *   **Auto-Resizing:** Automatically adjusts its height to fit the text content as users type.
    *   **Variable-Based Input Handles:** Dynamically creates input handles on the left side corresponding to `{{variableName}}` syntax within its text, allowing for templating and data injection.
*   **Node Connectivity:** Visually connect nodes via input/output handles to define pipeline flow, with animated edges.
*   **Modern & Unified Design:** A [**responsive dark theme with indigo accents**] ensures a visually appealing and consistent user experience, implemented with CSS Modules.
*   **Pipeline Analysis Submission:** Allows users to submit the constructed pipeline (nodes and edges) to a backend for structural analysis (e.g., DAG validation).
*   **Integrated React Flow Utilities:** Includes built-in controls for zoom/pan and a minimap for easy navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **React (v18+):** Core UI library.
*   **React Flow (v11+):** For building node-based editors and graphs.
*   **Zustand:** For lightweight global state management.
*   **CSS Modules:** For scoped and maintainable styling.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Primary programming language.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16.x or v18.x recommended)
*   npm (v8.x or v9.x recommended) or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/frontend
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you use Yarn)

### Running in Development Mode

1.  **Important:** For full functionality (especially the "Submit Pipeline" feature), ensure the backend server is running (see `backend/README.md`). It is expected to be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
2.  From the `frontend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3.  This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
